        Before model training, dataset characteristics were quantitatively analyzed to identify potential sources of training instability.
        Image height-to-width ratios and the number of distinct particles per image were measured from the generated masks and visualized using histograms.
        These diagnostics reveal variations in input geometry and scene complexity, which can significantly affect optimization behavior and convergence stability.
        By inspecting these distributions, extreme cases and data imbalance were identified in advance, informing preprocessing decisions and controlled dataset selection for subsequent experiments.

      <p>
        Although instance-level segmentation remained challenging in dense multi-particle images,
        the trained model consistently produced stable foreground localization.
        Since ADB is an area-derived physical quantity,
        segmentation outputs were therefore used as a measurement proxy rather than
        as exact instance delineations.
        To enable reliable ADB estimation, an inference-time calibration step was introduced.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Model:</strong> U-Net trained on the full dataset with fixed preprocessing (96×96).</li>
        <li><strong>Inference:</strong> 20 repeated runs to assess spatial consistency of predicted masks.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-processing:</strong> Iterative morphological erosion or dilation.</li>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Align area-derived measurements with physically meaningful ADB values.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Calibration compensates for systematic boundary bias in the predicted masks,
        which tend to exhibit slight boundary inflation and thus overestimate ADB.
        Erosion or dilation is applied iteratively, and calibration is stopped at the
        minimal step that brings the estimate into the target range,
        relying solely on aggregate foreground area statistics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Across repeated inference runs, the total foreground area showed low variance,
        enabling stable ADB estimation after calibration despite unreliable
        individual particle boundaries.
